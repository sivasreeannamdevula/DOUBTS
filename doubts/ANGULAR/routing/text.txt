in  package.json to use routing we need this
   "@angular/router": "~13.3.0",


1.define routes array in seperate .ts/app.modele.ts
2.imports [routerModule.forRoot(routes)]
3.<route-outlet>


routerLink----links html element to the route
routerLinkActive----used to add/remove css classes for element on which routerLink is
                   defined,if child route is active then all its parent routes are also active so to avoid it we use
                   [routerLinkActiveOptons]:{exact:true}



<!-- <a  href="#"  (click)="OnNavigation()" >Home</a> --> why not working?




doubts?
why routeLinkActiveOptions is not working as expected(p=child to parent)
why relative is not working in navigate
