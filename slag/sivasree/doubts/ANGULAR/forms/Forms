in normal forms when we submit the form an api request happens and reloading takes place
to avoid this in angular we use TEMPLATE DRIVEN/REACTIVE FORMS(if reloading took place then whole angular app restarts)



import FormsModule in app.module.ts as it contains all the necessary methods and attributes,directives

(ngSubmit)----- is an event that gets triggered when we submit the form
ngForm------- a directive in forms module that tells that we are using 
              TEMPLATE DRIVEN FORM and also stores the reference to json format of form

<form>       by defualt it is template driven form though we didnt mention ngForm explicitly


bydefault controls,values are empty, so to see those mark every element in form with name & ngModel(available in 
FormsModule that tells formscontrol to include in ngForm controls)

controls contain the each field as an FormControl object that is it has many properties like touched,dirty,status,value...
value contains just the values as an object



[ngForm-Controls for each formelement as well as whole form
value:
touched:foucussed or not using mouse
untouched:foucussed or not using mouse
dirty:input value changed from previous value
valid:validation is true or not
status:
]







we can add validatons like required,email 
/* we can add custom css like this */
input.ng-valid.ng-touched
{
    border:solid 2px red;
}


ngForm---js object of form
ngModel--js object of each control
ngModelGroup--js of group of controls

we can use template reference to display error messages


for setvalue we have to send the whole object but for patchvalue only the required things can be passed

reset===resets the state(ng-touched,ng-dirty...) and form controls to null/empty
